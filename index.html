        <h3>Sporting CP</h3>

        <p>The club where it all began.</p>

        <p>
          Started at the age of 16, Cristiano became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.
          <br><br>
          United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year.Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting £12.24 million for what he considered to be "one of the most exciting young players" he had ever seen.
          <br><br>
          A decade after his departure from the club, in April 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member.

        <h3>Manchester United FC</h3>

        <p>
            Sir Alex Ferguson, also known as the person who found Cristiano, brought him to Manchester United. It was then, that everything started to change for him. Ronaldo was the first Portuguese player to sign for the club. 
            <br><br>
            His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history. He received the squad number 7 shirt, that became an extra source of motivation for him.

        <h3>Real Madrid FC</h3>    
        <img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/02/ronaldo-7591.jpg" height="300px" alt="">

        <p>
            Ahead of the 2009-10 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time, of £80 million. 
            <br> <br>
            At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.
            <br>
            Since club captain Raúl already wore the number 7 (the number Ronaldo wore at United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt, which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano. 
        </p>

        <p>
            During a historic series of four Clásicos against rivals Barcelona in April 2011, Ronaldo scored twice to equal his personal record of 42 goals in all competitions. Though he failed to score in either leg of the Champions League semi-finals as Madrid were eliminated, he equalised from the penalty spot in the return league game and scored the match-winning goal in the 103rd minute of the 2011 Copa del Rey Final, winning his first trophy in Spain.

            <br><br>

            During the following season, Ronaldo achieved a new personal best of 60 goals in all competitions. He finished as runner-up to Messi for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or, after scoring hat-tricks against Real Zaragoza, Rayo Vallecano, Málaga, Osasuna and Sevilla, the last of which put Madrid on top of the league by the season's midway point

            <br><br>

            Ronaldo began the 2012-13 season by lifting the 2012 Supercopa de España, his third trophy in Spain. With a goal in each leg, he helped Madrid win the Spanish Super Cup on away goals following a 4-4 aggregate draw against Barcelona.
            <br>
            He became the first player to score in six successive Clásicos when he hit a brace in a 2-2 draw at Camp Nou. His performances again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the 2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or, behind four-time winner Messi.

            <br><br>
            In the season 2013 till 2015, he cnsecutively won Ballon d'Or and La Décima.

            <br><br>

            From 2015 to 2017, he became all-time Madrid top scorer.

            <br><br>

            During 2017-2018 he recieved Fifth Ballon d'Or and fifth Champions League title.

        <p>
            The transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old,[226] and the highest paid by an Italian club. 
            <br><br>
            2018-2020 appeared to be the time for adjustments in Juventus and of course, consecutive Serie A titles.
            <br>
            On 18 August, Ronaldo made his debut in a 3-2 away win against ChievoVerona. On 16 September, Ronaldo scored his first two goals for Juventus in his fourth appearance in a 2-1 home win over Sassuolo in Serie A; his second was the 400th league goal of his career.

            <br><br>

            In the season, 2020-2021 he completed 100 Juve goals and also departed from Juventus.
